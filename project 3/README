For this project i have created nine functions each for each request.

In each of the function I have used RegEx for the next prev links which are to be appended in the result.
In the sensordataByIdTs function I am sorting the data by the given timestamp as we only need one result and the sensors.js file is sending 5, I considered sending count as 1 to the sensors.js file but it didn't seem to be the right approach.
