For this project i have created nine functions each for each request.
I have mostly reffered to prof. Umrigars Example code given in the class, link is as follows:

https://zdu.binghamton.edu/cs544/slides/users-ws/code/user-ws/user-ws.js?colorize=true

I have used functions from the above example code to create this project.

In each of the function I have used RegEx for the next prev links which are to be appended in the result.
I have reffered the logic from the following link:

For the post functions I have used code from the example code given by professor.
In the sensordataByIdTs function I am sorting the data by the given timestamp as we only need one result and the sensors.js file is sending 5, I considered sending count as 1 to the sensors.js file but it didn't seem to be the right approach.
