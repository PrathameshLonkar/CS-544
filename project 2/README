In this project I have mainly used the mongo functions to add and find the data.
In each of the functions i have used the AppError method as specified by professor to throw any error and have also used the same method for validation.
In this project i have declared each collection as this and am accessing them to retrieve any data or find any data
I have also referred to the the official mongo website to understand concepts of mongo functions
