In this project I have mainly used the mongo functions to add and find the data.

In each of the functions i have used the AppError method as specified by professor to throw any error and have also used the same method for validation.

I have basically reffered to Prof. Umrigar Project 1 solution and the user-store file to make this project the links of the two are as follows:

https://zdu.binghamton.edu/cs544/slides/users-store/users-store.pdf

In this project i have declared each collection as this and am accessing them to retrieve any data or find any data

For the findSensorData function i have used Prof. Umrigar's logic to impliment my find function

I have also referred to the the official mongo website to understand concepts of mongo functions
